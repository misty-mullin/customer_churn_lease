# customer_churn_lease

This project was conducted to determine whether customdfrs would renew their lease or not on their hoome. There were several features, including age, fine violation, survey results, etc. This project starts with an EDA to get an idea of the proportion who do renew their lease. Then the variables were identified as either independent or dependent using a chi-square test. After that, the correlation of features were visualized using a heat map and the top variables of customers who churned were identified. The second part encludes deploying different machine learning models to predict the number of customers who renew and who do not renew. Since the nature of the data was binary and were classifying based on lease renewal, a few classification models were considered. The models that were tested included KNearest Neighbors, which is hte concept of items of similarity exist within close proximity of each other, Decission Trees, which includes splitting based on highest probability decision, and logistic regression. A brief test revealed that logistic regession performed the best at 80%. Finally, I created a pipeline that looped the data through different models to see if there were any others that may improve the accuracy. Next steps would be to optimize the hyperparameters after understanding the businessess's needs and values in regards to interpretation.
